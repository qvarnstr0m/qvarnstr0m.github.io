            Writing about oneself is always hard, so I asked chatGPT to write a
            little story about me, and we are quite happy with the result, even
            though chatGPT insisted on speculating on my future after my current
            situation:<br /><br />
            Once upon a time, there was a man who dabbled in building web pages
            as a hobby in his spare time. He enjoyed tinkering with code and
            designing websites, but he never considered pursuing it as a career.
            Instead, he followed a different path, one that led him to a job he
            didn't love and left him feeling unfulfilled.<br /><br />
            Years later, while browsing the internet, he stumbled upon an
            article about the latest advancements in software development.
            Intrigued, he began to read more and realized that his passion for
            programming had never really gone away. He decided to pursue it
            seriously this time and make it his mission to work in software
            development.<br /><br />
            He enrolled in an intensive two-year program in development, where
            he studied everything from basic programming concepts to advanced
            software engineering practices. He spent countless hours working on
            assignments, building projects, and collaborating with other
            students. It wasn't always easy, but he was determined to succeed.
            <br /><br />After completing the program, he landed a job at a
            startup company where he worked alongside a team of talented
            developers. Together, they built innovative applications that
            changed the way people lived their lives. He felt a sense of
            fulfillment that he had never experienced before. He was excited to
            wake up every day and work on projects that made a difference in the
            world.<br /><br />As time passed, he gained a reputation as a
            skilled developer. He received job offers from some of the biggest
            tech companies in the industry, but he wasn't interested in chasing
            fame or fortune. He had found his passion, and that was all that
            mattered. He continued to work in software development, always
            striving to improve his skills and make a difference in the world.
            He mentored young developers, volunteered his time to teach coding
            to underprivileged children, and even started his own software
            development company.<br /><br />Looking back, he realized that his
            years away from programming had actually helped him become a better
            developer. He had gained valuable experience and skills in other
            areas that he could now apply to his work. He had found his way back
            to programming, and he was grateful for the journey that had brought
            him there.<br /><br />
