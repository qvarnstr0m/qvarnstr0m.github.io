## Accessibility:  
To ensure that my website is accessible, I have checked it on various browsers to ensure that it is compatible with different devices and operating systems. I have also made sure that the website has good contrast between text and background to make it easier for users with visual impairments to read the content.

## Semantics:  
To ensure that my website is semantically correct, I have used appropriate HTML tags to structure the content. This includes using headings to indicate the hierarchy of the content and using lists to group related information. This helps users to understand the content and navigate the website more easily.

## Compatibility:  
To ensure that my website is compatible with different devices and browsers, I have used responsive design techniques. This means that the website adapts to the screen size of the device being used to view it, providing an optimal viewing experience. I have also tested the website on different browsers and devices to ensure that it works well across different platforms.

## Adaptation for different devices:  
To ensure that my website is adaptable for different devices, I have made it mobile-friendly and responsive. This means that the website will adjust its layout and design to fit the screen size of the device being used. This ensures that the website is easy to use and navigate on smaller screens, such as those of smartphones and tablets.  

Overall, I have made conscious technical choices to ensure that my website is accessible, semantically correct, compatible with different devices and browsers, and adaptable for different devices.
